**Fake news** is a piece of misleading/false information
published or presented in the form of news. It is generally intent to
defame the reputation of a person, group, entity or making easy
money through blackmailing or advertising revenue.

The following repo presents a
solution implemented in order to detect fake news and help any
user to identify fake news articles. The implemented solution makes use of an ensemble model comprising of multiple “machine
learning (ML)” models and “deep learning (DL)” model to provide
accurate results and predictions. The solution described here, takes
into consideration the text and images of any news article and
analyses in depth these elements of the article to produce a result
on whether the article is real or fake. <br>
